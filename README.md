# Overview

I created a statemachine module. A statemachine is an abstraction to used to design algorithms. 
The statemachine i created is for a car. A car many states and inputs. The program transitions from state to state based on the inputs and produces outputs. I created this to develop my skills in handling events, create callback functions and use inputs to make a transition to the next state. 
My purpose in writing this software is to expand my skills in erlang.
